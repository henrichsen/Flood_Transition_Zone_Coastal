This file has notes on commands needed to get catchment data from the Hydrofabric using 
and R package called hyAggregate. This data is needed to run models on catchments in the Next
Generation National Water Model Framework, and to use the Framework's routing scheme (T-Route).

An introduction to the Hydrofabric is located here: https://mikejohnson51.github.io/hyAggregate/
A link to the hyAggregate github is located here: https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/hydrofabric

Run these commands to install all the packages you need in RStudio:
install.packages("remotes")
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("sf")
install.packages("RSQLite")
install.packages("rgdal")
install.packages("RSQLite")
install.packages("RNetCDF")

remotes::install_github("USGS-R/nhdplusTools")
remotes::install_github("r-spatial/mapview")
library(mapview)
library("rgdal")

library("nhdplusTools")
library("hyAggregate")

Use these commands to get hydrofabric information:

1. Set a variable to the number of the HUC region you want to download. "12" will give you 
   the Western Gulf Coast region, including Texas and Louisiana. "01" will give you New England.
>VPU = "12"

2. Download the reference fabric:
>get_reference_fabric(VPU = VPU, type = "refactored", dir = 'data')
	This will print out a link, paste it into a browser to download the file.

2. set a variable to the location where you stored that downloaded file (my example path included below):
>filepath = '/Users/Abigail Sandquist/Documents/Hydrofabric/12/refactor_12.gpkg'

3. Run the aggreagate network to distribution function. This will create a new aggreagted geopackage 
   called ngen_12.gpkg in the directory you specify. My example filepath is shown in the line of code below:
>agg = aggregate_network_to_distribution(filepath, outfile = glue::glue("C:/Users/Abigail Sandquist/Documents/Hydrofabric/data/ngen_{VPU}.gpkg"), routelink_path = get_routelink_path(), overwrite = FALSE)
	
4. Download the netCFD NWM file from this link: 
   https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/requestDownload/629a4246d34ec53d276f446d?file[â€¦]sk__b3%2F38%2F67%2Fb33867bad71477b3adbc205eb508bbd3ccfdf623

5. Run the aggregate_cfe_noahowp function to a layer with CFE parameters to your geopackage. 
   Set the directory to the same folder that your ngen_12.gpkg is stored in. 
>agg_cfe = aggregate_cfe_noahowp(agg, dir = "C:/Users/Abigail Sandquist/Documents/Hydrofabric/data/", add_to_gpkg = TRUE)
	
	The output should look like this:

		INFO [2022-07-05 17:51:16] Building weighting grid from NETCDF:"C:/Users/Abigail Sandquist/Documents/Hydrofabric/data/ngen_gridded_data.nc":ISLTYP
		|=========================================================================| 100%

		SUCCESS [2022-07-05 17:53:12] Done!

You now have a geopackage with all the parameters of cfe for every catchment in HUC 12. 
If you want to subselect a smaller region from the Hydrofabric, follow the steps below:

6. Set a variable to the location of your ngen_12.gpkg.
>gpkg = '/Users/Abigail Sandquist/Documents/Hydrofabric/data/ngen_12.gpkg' 

7. Set a variable to the name of the waterbody where your desired subsection drains to. 
   For Cedar Bayou in Galveston Bay, that value is wb-36361.
>origin = 'wb-36361'
	You can find this by opening the gpkg in ArcGIS, or you can use the find_origin function.
	An example of using the find origin function is shown below:
>pt = data.frame(x = 2141136, y = 2824888) |>
st_as_sf(coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 5070)
>origin = find_origin(gpkg, pt)

8. 
>write_ngen_dir(gpkg)

9. Run the subset_network function:
>set = subset_network(gpkg, origin = origin)

	NOTE: IF THIS DOES NOT WORK, IT IS BECAUSE SOME VARIABLES
	IN THE FUNCTION MAY BE MISNAMED. YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN 
	FUNCTION WITH THE CORRECT VARIABLE NAMES WITH THE FOLLOWING 
	CODE:
_______________________________________________________
subset_net = function (gpkg, origin, mainstem = FALSE) 
{
  trace = get_sorted(read_sf(gpkg, "flowpath_edge_list"), 
                     split = TRUE, outlets = origin)
  flowpaths = filter(read_sf(gpkg, "aggregate_flowpaths"), 
                     id %in% trace$id)
  divides = filter(read_sf(gpkg, "aggregate_divides"), id %in% 
                     flowpaths$realized_catchment)
  if (mainstem) {
    tmp = filter(flowpaths, id == origin)
    flowpaths = filter(flowpaths, main_id == tmp$main_id)
  }
  return(list(flowpaths = flowpaths, divides = divides))
}	
____________________________________________________________

	IF YOU USE THIS FUNCTION,  use subset_net() instead of 
	subset_network() function name when running the command
	for step 9. 

10. To view your subselection in the mapviewer in R:
>mapview::mapview(set)

To write the subselected region as a layer in your geopackage, use the following commands:

11. Set the name of the catchment and flowpath layers (use different names if you plan to 
    write have multiple subselected regions in teh same geopakage):
>flowpath_name = "subset_flowpaths"
>catchment_name = "subset_divides"

12. Assign variable names to each layer of the subset_network output
flowpaths = set$flowpaths
divides = set$divides

13. Write the layers to the geopackage (the path to the geopakcage should still be 
    stored under the variable name 'gpkg')
>write_sf(flowpaths, gpkg, flowpath_name)
>write_sf(divides, gpkg, catchment_name)
>write_ngen_dir(gpkg, catchment_name=catchment_name, flowpath_name = flowpath_name)

You should now have subselected layers added to the geopackage, and an output of all 
the geojson and json files needed to run models on hydrofabric catchments in the ngen 
framework with T-route. 

If you want to run another subselection, change the filepath destination and run 
steps 6-13 again. Change the 'flowpath_name' and 'catchment_name' to something else
so that the layers for the new subselected area don't have the same name as the first
one you ran.
